<p>
The external buffer memory (EBM) is used to generate random pages (*1) of data to be later loaded into the buffer memory (BM) as needed by the pattern for read and write operations.
</p>
<ul><li>
    <p>
    (*1) Page (or plane) will be referred to as &quot;transfer area&quot; in this manual.
    A transfer area may consist of multiple pages (or planes) depending on the memory device being tested.
    </p>

    (b): Automatically generated signal to request more transfer area(s) to be loaded into the iBM
    </p>
    </li><li><p>
    (c): JBF instruction to wait for the completion of transfer
    </p>
    </li><li><p>
    (d): MUT signal specified by user to request another transfer area to be sent
    </p>
</li></ul>
<p>
The EBM resides in the memory space of the test site controller (TSC).
It is large enough to hold many data, typically one or several blocks.
Data is transferred to the intermediate buffer memory (iBM), a 72K x 16 memory, which holds several transfer areas.
And then on to the BM which resides in the ALPG.
The BM is small and holds one transfer area at a time.
</p>
<p>
The transfer of data from the EBM to the BM happens while the pattern is running.
A MUT signal is defined to be used within a pattern to request a transfer area from the EBM.
This is followed by a JBF instruction to hold the pattern at a vector while the transfer completes.
Once the JBF instruction has cleared, the pattern then continues and the instruction DS is used to present the BM data to the ALPG for a read or write operation.
The BMINC instruction is used to increment the BM to the next column.
It resets when a new transfer area is loaded.
This repeats until the entire transfer area is complete.
</p>
<p>
As an example, consider a DUT with a transfer size of 17664 columns.
The iBM is large enough to hold 8 transfer areas of data.
The pattern will continue to use the MUT signal to transfer one transfer area at a time to the BM.
But when the 8 transfers complete, the EBM will reload the iBM up with the next 8 transfer areas to be transferred.
</p>
<p>
The transfer size is normally set to the same size as the DUT page size.
In the preceding example, the transfer size would be set to 17664 columns.
But it is not necessary to have the transfer size be equal to the DUT page size.
The transfer size can be a multiple such as 2 x the DUT page size, first do a page program operation and then a page read operation.
In the pattern, use the BMINC instruction to move the BM column pointer.
So after doing the page program operation, the pointer is now ready to do the second half for the read operation.
